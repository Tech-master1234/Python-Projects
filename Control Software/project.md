# Network PC Control Software - Development Specification

## Project Overview
Develop a cross-platform network administration tool that enables authorized administrators to remotely manage Windows PCs in a network environment. The software should provide secure remote control capabilities for basic power management operations.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### Remote Operations
- **Sleep**: Put target machines into sleep/standby mode
- **Restart**: Perform clean system restart
- **Shutdown**: Perform clean system shutdown
- **Status Check**: Query current system status and uptime

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Target Systems**: Windows PCs (Windows 10/11, Windows Server)
- **Control Platforms**: Both Windows and Linux administrative machines
- **Interfaces**: Command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI)

## Architecture Requirements

### Distributed Administration
- Any authorized device on the network can serve as an admin console
- No single point of failure - decentralized control model
- Dynamic role assignment based on authentication

### Security Framework
- **Authentication**: Username/password based authorization system
- **Encryption**: All network communications must be encrypted (TLS/SSL)
- **Authorization Levels**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Audit Logging**: Complete logging of all administrative actions
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout

## Technical Specifications

### Network Communication
- Secure protocols only (HTTPS, SSH, or custom encrypted protocol)
- Configurable port ranges for firewall compatibility
- Network discovery for automatic device detection
- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6

### Installation & Deployment
- Lightweight agent installation on target Windows PCs
- Minimal system resource usage
- Silent installation options for enterprise deployment
- Automatic service registration and startup

### User Interface Requirements

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)
```bash
# Example commands
pccontrol --target 192.168.1.100 --action shutdown --auth admin:password
pccontrol --scan-network --subnet 192.168.1.0/24
pccontrol --list-devices --status
```

#### Graphical Interface (GUI)
- Network topology view showing all managed devices
- Device status dashboard (online/offline, last seen, system info)
- Bulk operations for multiple devices
- Real-time operation status and progress indicators
- Configuration management interface

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure credential storage (encrypted/hashed passwords)
- Multi-factor authentication support (optional)
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Failed login attempt monitoring and lockout

### Network Security
- Certificate-based authentication between components
- Encrypted configuration files
- Secure key exchange mechanisms
- Network traffic encryption

### Compliance & Auditing
- Comprehensive audit trails

- Integration with existing Active Directory/LDAP systems
- Configurable security policies

## Configuration Management

### Device Management
- Device grouping and tagging
- Scheduled operations (maintenance windows)
- Custom device profiles and settings
- Import/export device lists

### System Configuration
- Centralized configuration management
- Policy-based device control
- Backup and restore configuration
- Version control for configuration changes

## Error Handling & Reliability

### Robust Error Management
- Graceful handling of network failures

- Clear error reporting and logging
- Fallback communication methods

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time device status monitoring
- Alert system for device failures
- Performance metrics and reporting
- Health check capabilities

## Deployment Scenarios
